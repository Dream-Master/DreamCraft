That is an In-Game Info (IGI) mod. \nSome of the info it gives is useful right away, some of it shines later on in progression.\n\nFor now, the most important thing it does is showing if you are in an ore chunk. Further quests will explain what it means.\n\nIf you want to hide it, type \"/igi disable\" in the chat. \nType \"/igi enable\" if you want to turn it back on.\n\n§TThe command \"/igi config\" opens the configuration window to control its position, scale, and size.\n\nThe command \"/xu_tps\" toggles the Ticks Per Second (TPS) meter from the mod Extra Utilities.  \nTPS is a measure of how well your server is running. The ideal TPS is 20. \nIf TPS is less than 15, thing are going to start lagging noticeably. \nAt TPS of 10 or less, it is going to be hard to play.\nThe tooltip shows three types of TPS: instantaneous, average, and worst-case.\nIf you need suggestions on solving TPS problems, feel free to ask for help in the GTNH Discord."
