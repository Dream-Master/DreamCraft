This info is displayed by InGame Info XML mod. For now, you need to see chunk info like \"Chunk X: 3 Z: -2\".\n\nThe 3,-2 is the chunk\u0027s address. Ignore the negative sign. The orecenters are located at 3N+1 chunks. So, 4,7 is an orecenter, as well as 10,16, -22,19, and so on.\n\nThe generation of Ore Chunks is not related to biomes.\n\nFor reading all the way, here\u0027s some iron."
