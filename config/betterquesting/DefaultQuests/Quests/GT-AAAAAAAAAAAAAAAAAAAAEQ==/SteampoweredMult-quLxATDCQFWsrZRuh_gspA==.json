However, don\u0027t get too excited quite yet. While there are some multiblocks accessible in the Steam Age, most of them only unlock in EV or later, including a better version of this macerator.\n\n§rIt only works 8 at a time, but is faster. Note that this multi requires §c§4§lVery Specific§r I/O blocks, don\u0027t mess it up."
