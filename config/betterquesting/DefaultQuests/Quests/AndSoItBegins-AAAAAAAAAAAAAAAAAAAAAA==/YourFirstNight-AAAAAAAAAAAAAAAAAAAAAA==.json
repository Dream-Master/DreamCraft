Use the Tilde (~) button to open quests without the book§r ...if your keybinds don\u0027t conflict.\n\nIf you need some extra help or just want to hang out, feel free to visit our Discord server at §1§n[url]discord.gg/gtnh[/url]§r - the links are clickable. Select your tech tier in #role-select - it will help people to tailor their advice to your situation.\n\nMany GTNH topics are explained in our Wiki at §1§n[url]gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page[/url]§r. Some things need more text to explain than the questbook (QB) can do.\nAlso, pictures. \nAlso, beginner guides if you think the questbook is not enough. There is also a list of optional mods for those who want to be even fancier.\n\nAdditionally, there is a spreadsheet at §1§n[url]bit.ly/gtnh-datasheets[/url]§r for the info you would want a spreadsheet for.\n\nIf you play through the §4CurseForge§r launcher, be aware that it doesn\u0027t always work properly. The Curse launcher doesn\u0027t play well with custom versions of mods that this pack has. So if you have any problems, first switch to another launcher like MultiMC§r, Prism Launcher§r, or Technic§r. The latest version of the pack is available on the Discord channel from #announcements or with the !download command.\n\nHopefully you didn\u0027t get munched by a monster while reading this."
