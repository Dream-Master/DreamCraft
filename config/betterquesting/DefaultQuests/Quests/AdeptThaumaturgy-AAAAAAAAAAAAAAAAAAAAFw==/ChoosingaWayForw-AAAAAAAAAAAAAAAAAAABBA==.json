You wish to go further, find out what lies at the end of this road. Or where your end lies alongside it.\n\nYou know the danger: Warp. That mysterious power calling out to you, surely watching even now. Waiting for you. Sooner or later there will be a confrontation. Where you will either be prepared to overcome this final trial, or learn what it means to not be.\n\nIfnkovhgroghprm said you are ready to open the path, if you manage to find it. So you have two choices. Delay the inevitable a little bit longer, gather greater tools and power to triumpth in this crucial moment, or - if you are ready - bring the fight to the beast\u0027s own belly.\n\nÂ§3Infusion recipes from here on are likely going to be more unstable than the ones shown in the Novice Thaumaturgy page, so prepare your Infusion Altar accordingly."
