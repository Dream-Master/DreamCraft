Seeing the flow, feeling how much easier it was to draw upon... you wish to experience that again.\n\nIt\u0027s only fitting to upgrade your old goggles to let you catch a glimpse of the void. Not directly of course, that is either not how the void works or not how you §owant§r it to work within a biome\u0027s distance of you ideally. You want to see the patterns. The disruptions, the ripples they leave in their wake.\n\nYou\u0027re confident you\u0027ll have an easier time channeling Vis as a result. Unfortunately the goggles are not exactly what you would call protective gear, but you\u0027ve always recognized the difference between armor and gear specialized for channeling Vis."
