Cutting the bones into Bone Needles will increase the Mortuus yield per bone.\n\nA server viable option is an Extreme Entity Crusher running regular Skeletons, which is fast enough on EV power.\n\nAlso server viable are Corpseplant or Belladonna IC2 crops, ideally statted. Corpseplant yields more Mortuus per bone through Bone Needles, but Belladonna has one fewer growth stage and doesn\u0027t share a drop table with Rotten Flesh.\n\nEither which way you\u0027ll need 1 Mortuus Essentia every 3 seconds, minimum, to keep a Soul Brazier running.\n\n§3Worth repeating: If you\u0027re on a server §lvery strongly§r§3 consider not going the Skeleton Druid mob farm method. The performance impact of in world mob farms is considerable, and multiplied per player that escalates very quickly."
