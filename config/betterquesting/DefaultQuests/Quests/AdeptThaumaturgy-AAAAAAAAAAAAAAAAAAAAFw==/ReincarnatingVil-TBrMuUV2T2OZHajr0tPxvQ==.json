You are able to combine them, not as they once were but whole none the less.\n\nBy placing a Soulforge above a Soul Sieve, and feeding the former Cognitio Essentia through the top lid, fragmented souls will collide and merge together, until a whole soul is formed. They will be stored within the Soulforge until collected with a Warded Jar.\n\nTo reincarnate these souls you will need to use your Curative Vat. Place a Corpse Effigy inside, and revive it by feeding it eight Victus and eight Sano Essentia. Than right click the Curative Vat with a soul contained in a warded jar to unite the two into a living villager.\n\nTo free the villager from the Curative Vat simply right click the top hatch with an empty Warded Jar - like the one that used to contain the villager\u0027s soul a moment ago - to capture them inside the jar. Release the villager be placing the jar somewhere and right-clicking it with a wand, as you would free a jarred node.\n\nNo longer will you have to scour the overworld for villages to hopefully find decent trades. Now you will create villagers - and villages - yourself, within the comfort of your own home. Well, minus the trips to the Nether to gather Soul Sand, of course."
