You need a better solution.\n\nThe Osmotic Enchanter lets you choose which enchants you want, and uses Vis from an inserted wand or scepter to enchant items instead of consuming experience.\n\nYou will also be able to research enchantments from all sorts of fields of study (read: Thaumonomicon tabs) that a basic Enchantment Table, or technology based off of it, could not replicate.\n\nYou should note that multiple high level enchants can get expensive, but the process won\u0027t become unstable or degenerate if Vis runs out, so you can swap out scepters at your leisure."
