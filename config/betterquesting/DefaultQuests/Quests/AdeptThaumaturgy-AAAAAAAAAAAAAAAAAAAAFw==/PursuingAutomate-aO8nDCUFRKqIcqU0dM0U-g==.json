It\u0027s not §ohard§r, not with the knowledge you gain from the myriad of machines you\u0027ve crafted, but those same machines taught you not to do manually what you can automate.\n\nOf course figuring out something that can do research for you is easier said than done. The first step is crafting a Aura Core attuned to Ordo. This, in fact, might very well be the hardest step of this entire process.\n\nFirst craft a Blank Aura Core using your Infusion Altar. The recipe requires a random amount of Essentia, causing neither Thaumonomicon or NEI to show what types of Essentia the craft actually requires. For the record you need Alienis, Auram, Praecantatio and Vacuos.\n\nGreat start? It gets worse.\n\nWhen you consume a Crystal Cluster to bind a blank aura core it doesn\u0027t simply bind to the cluster\u0027s primal. Instead it checks a four block radius around it in all directions, checks the aspects those blocks have (either primal aspects, or what primal aspects a compound aspect contains), and uses the amount of aspects it counted as a basis for a §orandom chance§r for what primal to bind with.\n\nThe best §ochance§r at getting an Ordo bound core is to build a solid 5x5x5 cube of Quartz blocks at least five blocks above a level surface. Dig out the middle block on the top layer, and replace it with an Ordo crystal cluster. Surround the hole with four more Quartz blocks. Chuck the blank Aura core into the hole, activate the mystical construct with a sufficiently powerful wand, and pray to Creepthulhu for good RNG.\n\nIf you don\u0027t get it you can unbind an Aura Core and try again, at least."
