If you were to create a powered spawner of these creatures you could harvest them for their Ethereal Essence, in all flavours of Essentia available.\n\nAs with all plans involving a mob farm, though, this is going to require very careful consideration. §oEspecially§r this one, given that Wisps are able to fly around freely. Not securely contained they could leave the range of the spawner, causing more to be spawned and escape, until their very presence was enough to bring the world\u0027s machinations to a halt."
