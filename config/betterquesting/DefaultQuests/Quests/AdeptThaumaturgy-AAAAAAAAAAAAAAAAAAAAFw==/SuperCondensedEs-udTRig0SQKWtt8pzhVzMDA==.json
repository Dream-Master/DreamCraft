      "desc:8": "This is probably one of the most terrifying devices you\u0027ve created yet. You were, once, concerned about making your Warded Jars larger because they would no longer be portable. Essentia is unstable, and containing much larger quantities would quickly become problematic.\n\nAnd now here you are, putting together a device capable of storing up to 46 (and change) of those jars, §oper aspect§r, inside a single device. Truly your genius knows no bounds. Or any bounds of any sort, for that matter.\n\nIn any event, once the required items have been crafted the device is surprisingly simple to set up. The Thaumonomicon explains the process well enough. All you have to add is that Elements of Darkness add more storage space than one would expect (around a dozen total will maximize capacity), and that that process does require Ancient Pedestals specifically.\n\nThe real challenge is in figuring out how to fill the device automatically. Golems cannot tell whether it\u0027s full of a given Essentia, so they\u0027re not easily told to fill the Essentia Condenser if space is available, and dump any excess into an Oblivion Jar otherwise. Letting the device feed itself is much slower, though...\n\nA puzzle you will have to continue to ponder at a later date. For now, with Essentia distribution made possible through Essentia Mirrors, and Essentia storage made possible through this Essentia Condenser, it\u0027s time to consider the issue of supply...\n\n§3Confused as to how to craft an Aqua Aura core? See the quest Pursuing Automated Research in this quest tab for an explanation on Aura Cores, and craft an Aqua bound core by binding a core in the middle of a lake/river."
