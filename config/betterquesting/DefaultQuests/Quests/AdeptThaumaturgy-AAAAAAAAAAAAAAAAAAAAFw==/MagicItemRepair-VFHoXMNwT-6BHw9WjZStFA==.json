The Thaumic Restorer will use Instrumentum Essentia to repair most (read: Non-TiC or GT) tools. It\u0027s also able to repair a few non-tool items. To check if something can be repaired simply try to place it in the Restorer. If it can\u0027t, it can\u0027t.\n\nÂ§3Ignore the Thaumic Restorer saying it needs Perditio when looking at it with Goggles of Revealing. It most definitely uses Instrumentum, and only that."
