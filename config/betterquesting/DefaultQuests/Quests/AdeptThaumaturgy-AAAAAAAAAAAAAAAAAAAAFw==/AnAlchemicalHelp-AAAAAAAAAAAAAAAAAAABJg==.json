Essentia is volatile and easily turns into Flux, but surely you can do better.\n\nTurns out you actually can\u0027t. At least not yet. So instead you\u0027ve created a magical automaton to do the manual labor for you.\n\nRight click the golem against an Alchemical Furnace (or other source you want your golem to take Essentia from) to set that as it\u0027s home/input location. Right click the golem with an animation core to animate it. Right click a golem with a Golemancer\u0027s Bell to start designating valid dropoff points, then right-click such locations with the bell to mark them.\n\nNot every jar you want filled needs to be individually marked, golems are smart enough to recognize collections of adjacent jars if one of them is marked. Though keep the golem\u0027s maximum working range in mind.\n\nGolem pathfinding can charitably be described as \"there\", so make sure their route from A to B is as straightforward as possible. For the same reason golems with higher carry capacity - which does determine Essentia carry capacity for Alchemy golems - are generally preferred over faster golems, given that fewer trips means less pathfinding."
