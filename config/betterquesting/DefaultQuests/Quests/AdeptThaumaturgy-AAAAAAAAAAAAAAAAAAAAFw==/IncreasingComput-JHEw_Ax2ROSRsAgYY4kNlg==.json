Even managing your time efficiently has its limits, you need a better solution.\n\nThe Research Completer multiblock machine is exactly what it says on the tin: Feed it power, give it a node to savagely devour with no hint of mercy or remorse like the cold, unfeeling machine that it is, and it will complete research notes for you.\n\nÂ§3Don\u0027t even bother trying to use this multi without Empowering bees. It\u0027ll chew through nodes so quickly you\u0027d spend more time collecting nodes than you would completing research manually. Let stand doing something else while a Book of Knowledge does the research for you."
