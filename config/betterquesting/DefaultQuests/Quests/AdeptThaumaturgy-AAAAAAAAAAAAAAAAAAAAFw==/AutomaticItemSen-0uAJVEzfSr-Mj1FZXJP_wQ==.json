Seeking a solution lead you to the Magic Hand Mirror, able to do just that... but only by manually shoving items through it. Surely you can come up with an automated solution.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t easy, but you did find one. The Hungry Hand Mirror, once bound to one of a paired set of Magic Mirrors, can be given up to two Runic lists to fine tune what items coming into your inventory should be automatically fed through the hand mirror. And spat out at the Magic Mirror it is linked to.\n\nA Runic Whitelist simply tells the mirror what items to send. You can filter up to nine items individually, or use a simple name filter to send items matching that. For example \"* ore\" (minus quotes) will send through most all ores and ore-related stuff you pick up. The space is required since otherwise any c§lore§rs would get send as well.\n\nA Runic Blacklist can be used to specify a quantity of items that should remain on your person, with any excess being send, or items that should not get send period. Handy if you wish to keep a stack of stone or dirt on you as building blocks."
