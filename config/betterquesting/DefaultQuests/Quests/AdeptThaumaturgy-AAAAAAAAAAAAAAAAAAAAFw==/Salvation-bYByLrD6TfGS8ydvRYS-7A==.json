Given what you have available, you cannot find anything powerful enough to accomplish that task... directly.\n\n§oIndirectly§r has turned out to be another matter. While the red soap \"merely\" sheds normal Warp more effectively, the purple soap is able to - rarely - remove one point of permanent Warp, at the cost of inflicting two points of normal Warp regardless of whether the permanent removal succeeded.\n\nOf course while this success would ordinarily be cause for great celebration - a true solution to Warp at last! - you\u0027ve learned from your dabbling in technology that logistics cannot be ignored. And the logistics of this solution are... problematic.\n\nSimply put, this is too much. Given how far you will have to go in research, how much Warp you will accrue in the process, the low odds of success this soap has... no. It simply is not logistically viable. Not without a §osignificantly§r improved alchemical furnace design at the very least.\n\nSo, unfortunately, this solution is on hold until you find the means to either address the low chance of success, or some means of scaling up your Essentia production to levels that leave your poor Thaumium furnaces in the dust. Ideally, both."
