A Vortex Attenuator, activated with a redstone signal, will send out a beam that does just that. The beam will travel a maximum of nine block spaces between node and Attenuator before it fails to reach the node.\n\nWith this you should be able to safely-well, §omore§r safely set up a contraption for feeding a Hungry node items to consume their aspects. The only problem is... why? Why spend so much time and resources doing what a family of insects can do so much better, and so much faster?\n\nThere must be more you can do with this. You §ocannot§r accept having come this far only to be schooled by a swarm - not even a proper school! - of §obees§r!"
