      "desc:8": "You\u0027ve tried many times to automate your Infusion Altar, but one consistent problem was the issue of research. An Infusion Altar cannot be activated if the person waving the wand doesn\u0027t know the recipe, and no form of automation you\u0027ve tried so far could. Until now.\n\nThe Infusion Claw is bound to your soul, sharing your Thaumaturgical knowledge and, as such, is capable of activating an Infusion Altar on it\u0027s own. It\u0027ll need a wand (or staff, ideally), but this finally lets you automate infusion.\n\nThere are, of course, multiple caveats. But you have solutions for §oall§r of those problems.\n\nFirst, the Infusion Claw will add instability to an infusion every time it is pulsed. So a redstone clock won\u0027t work. What will are Remote Comparators, Tally Boxes and Redcrystal. By setting a Crystalline Eye to watch the central pedestal you can have a Tally Box remotely check for whitelisted items - crafting ingredients - and send a redstone signal if one is detected. This activates the Claw, and only once, since the signal is held§r until the ingredient item is gone. Or IOW, the infusion is finished.\n\nSecond, the staff in the Infusion Claw will drain a bit of Vis every time it\u0027s used. The emptier the staff the more instability will be generated, and Amber Staves are not a solution since total capacity is also a major factor. And Amber Staves wouldn\u0027t recharge Vis automatically inside the Infusion Claw anyhow.\n\nThis is where Vis Charge Relays come in. They can be placed on top of an Infusion Claw - looking a tad silly in the process, but cé la vie - and, given centi-Vis, will automatically recharge the staff inside the Claw.\n\nThe third, and final, caveat is simply the logistical challenge. Making sure each infusion recipe appears one after the other, that each set of items has symmetric partners where possible... it\u0027s certainly more difficult than the technology you are used to.\n\nExcept that\u0027s only because you haven\u0027t advanced far enough into technology yet. You\u0027ve heard many stories about the Assembly Line, the final frontier of automation, and you know what? With the Claw set up the Infusion Altar is basically a magic Assembly Line. The §oexact same§r automation that solves the Assembly Line, solves the Infusion Altar.\n\nWell, mostly the same. You will need a filtered item extraction to retrieve the finished product from the central pedestal, rather than taking it from the output bus, but that\u0027s easy. Alternatively you could do shenanigans with redstone - since the Tally Boxes are filtered to detect crafting ingredients it stands to reason the inverse of that signal will detect finished items (or irrelevant emptiness).\n\n§3Feeling automated infusion is still too slow? Head over to the Applied Energistics tab and look for the Infusion Intercepter. It lets you speed up the Essentia feeding stage, greatly speeding up crafting."
