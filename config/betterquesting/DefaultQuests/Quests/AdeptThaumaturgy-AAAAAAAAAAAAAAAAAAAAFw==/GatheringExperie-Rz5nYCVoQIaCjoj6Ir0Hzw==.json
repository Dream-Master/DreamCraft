Nor were you ready to look into it yourself.\n\nToday that changes. The Soul Sieve is a device able to, quite literally, separate the souls from the sand. The sand will be deposited below, preferrably into a chest, whereas the souls - scattered fragments thereof, more specifically - will be deposited above into some manner of suitable container.\n\nThe device works quite slowly normally, but thankfully providing it with a supply of Aer centi-Vis speeds it up tremendously.\n\nFor now all you are able to do with those soul fragments is feed them to a Brain in a Jar, so it can convert the knowledge and memories into experience for you to retrieve later. This seems horribly wasteful, though. Surely there is more you can do with the knowledge of such a large sample of life..."
