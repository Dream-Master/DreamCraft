They also don\u0027t have any penalties repairing the same item repeatedly, but you don\u0027t expect to make much use of that trait.\n\nWhat Thaumium Anvils cannot do is repair themselves like other Thaumium items, there\u0027s simply way too much of it here for that to be practical, or apply enchants beyond their normal level cap. I.E. you could get a Sharpness VI book from Disenchanting an Overchanted item, but using that book in an anvil would only yield Sharpness V still.\n\nÂ§3Diamond Spikes are an example of items you want to enchant, but that cannot be enchanted easily through means other than books in an anvil."
