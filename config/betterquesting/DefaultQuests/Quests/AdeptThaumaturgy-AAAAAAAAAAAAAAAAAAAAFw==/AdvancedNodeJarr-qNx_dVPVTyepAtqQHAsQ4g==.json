Feels long overdue.\n\nOne thing you\u0027ll have to keep in mind is to keep a wand or staff on you when jarring nodes from now on. Scepters or Staffters can be used to form mystical constructs, which a jarred node technically is, but they cannot use foci. And the silverwood blocks must be warded through a foci for the jarring process to work.\n\nYou know, thinking back you didn\u0027t want to craft a Staff for lack of ability to create one \"good enough\". You\u0027ve advanced, and gotten better materials too since then...maybe now is a good time?\n\nÂ§3The recipe for Warded Glass does not consume the Warding Focus, for the record."
