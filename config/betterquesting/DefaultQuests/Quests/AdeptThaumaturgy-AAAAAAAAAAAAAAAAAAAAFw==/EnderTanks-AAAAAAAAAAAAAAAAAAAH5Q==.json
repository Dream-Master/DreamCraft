Only with Ender Tanks you apply the diamond to the dial, not the lock.\n\nSpeaking of, right click the dial to toggle fluid auto-extraction. If the orange squares are up, it\u0027s turned on. Ender Tanks auto-extract at a rate of 100mb/t, although their actual throughput can be much higher if you use GT pumps (or other means) to insert/extract fluids faster.\n\nÂ§3If you get FPS problems from large numbers of them, try the setting in the config to turn off the fancy render at the bottom."
