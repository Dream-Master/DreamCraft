Sometimes you wonder how you managed to get this far given your tendency to forget stuff so easily.\n\nIn any case, Ender Pouches can be sneak-right clicked on an Ender Chest to set the pouch to the same channel as the chest. That gives you, effectively, that specific channel of Ender Chest in convenient backpack form.\n\nJust be careful not to put the Ender Pouch inside itself when clearing your inventory of a bunch of junk. Because you can, in fact, do that."
