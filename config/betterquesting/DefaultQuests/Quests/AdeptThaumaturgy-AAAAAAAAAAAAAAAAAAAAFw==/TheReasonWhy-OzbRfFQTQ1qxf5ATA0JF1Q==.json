There were two shards you encountered, one from the Nether and one from the End, which seemed to hold the essence of their respective dimension.\n\nYou thought each dimension was created equal, an island in a vast cosmos. You were wrong. Nether and End are two extremes, opposites so far removed you cannot begin to imagine. All other space you know contained between the lines they draw.\n\nHow you\u0027d do it eludes you, but you understand the theory. With these shards you can grasp both edges, draw upon the power of the void between. The §oentire§r void. Where Void Metal draws upon a fraction of a drop, you could draw upon an entire ocean.\n\nThis must be what convinced Ifnkovhgroghprm to turn his back. Figuring out a recipe would take so much study. The Warp one would accrue in the process... no wonder he often spoke of inevitable confrontations. You will not reach the end without overcoming Warp. How could anyone hope to overcome this hurdle otherwise.\n\nYou want this power. To see its potential, its limits. And you know - always have known - what you must do in order to get it.\n\n§3BTW, don\u0027t bother with the infusion recipe for crafting these shards. Bees or EEC has you covered there."
