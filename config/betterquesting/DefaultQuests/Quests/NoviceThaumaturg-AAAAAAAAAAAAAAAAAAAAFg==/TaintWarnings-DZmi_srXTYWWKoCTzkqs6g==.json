      "desc:8": "Now that you have started using Vis in the form of Essentia your mentor says it\u0027s time to cover Taint, and why you should be mindful of it.\n\nYour mentor mentioned before how Vis and Essentia are like water and ice - the same thing, but in different states. Vis in the state of Essentia is unstable in any conditions a person can hope to exist in, meaning it must be contained to remain as Essentia. Otherwise, like a block of ice in a hot desert, it will eventually change state.\n\nYour Crucible is an example of the latter. Left alone too long, or emptied out of the Crucible, Essentia will break down and change state. But not into Vis. Rather, it will turn into Flux.\n\nFlux manifests as a liquid or a gas, but is, itself, only a nuisance. Thaumaturges exposed to the stuff can end up getting Flux Flue, a condition which makes it harder to channel Vis, but it is only temporary.\n\nLarger concentrations of Flux will solidify into Thaumic Slimes, bizarre creatures that try to merge with each other to grow larger. They can be dangerous (read: Always Infernal), but are no less susceptible to crossbow bolts than most things.\n\nHowever, if too much flux is allowed to linger for too long, it will corrupt the land and solidify into tendrils. This is a manifestation of the blight called Taint. Fibrous Tendrils (as well as condensed blocks thereof) spread the Tainted Lands, feeding on the magic it twists. Nodes are especially vulnerable, becoming Tainted themselves if exposed to this twisted magic.\n\nDestroying the tendrils stops the spread, but unless §oall§r are destroyed this is only temporary. A more effective solution is to destroy the Tainted Land itself, as outside this specific biome tendrils quickly starve and die off.\n\nAs a final note your mentor pointedly mentions that if you are §oexceedingly§r careless with your Crucible you can, in fact, create Tainted Lands. So you would be wise to try wasting as little Essentia as possible, and clean up any you do waste.\n\n§3Those who are coming into TC4 from TC6: Making a mess with your crucible is not required progression, and thus easy, as it is in TC6. In TC4 creating Tainted Lands is strictly a punishment if you are outright negligent about your crucible work.\n\nAs in confirming it was even possible involved dissolving 256 Arcane Bores. So, you know, don\u0027t be afraid to use a crucible."
