Well, you §ocan§r, but crafting them with a phial of Essentia means keeping a stockpile of dozens upon dozens of phials on hand, searching for the one you need, accidentally emptying it instead of putting it back and being confused why it\u0027s nowhere to be found later and having to get a new one... the process could be more convenient, is what you\u0027re saying.\n\nThe Aspect Library is exactly what you were looking for. A quick reference collection detailing the aspects you\u0027ve discovered, enough to let you pre-filter labels without making a mess of anything.\n\nYou know, your mentor was right. Sometimes it\u0027s the little things that saves you the most work."
