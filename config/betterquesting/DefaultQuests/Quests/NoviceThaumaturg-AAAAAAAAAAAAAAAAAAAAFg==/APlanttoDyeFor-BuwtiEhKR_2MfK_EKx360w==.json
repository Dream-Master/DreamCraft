That stand up comedian career would never have worked out.\n\nAnyhow, you\u0027ve gotten quite tired of having to juggle over a dozen things just to make sure you\u0027ve got all colors of dye on hand. Especially red, purple, and... well, you go through a lot of dye, is the thing.\n\nRainbow Cacti grow like normal cacti, but can be harvested for dyes. All colors can drop, but only so many will drop per harvest. Break the second or third block to harvest dyes. Break the first block to retrieve the Rainbow Cacti blocks intact, should you wish to move it.\n\nYou\u0027ve also made sure that these cacti don\u0027t have damaging thorns, since otherwise harvesting them would be quite the puzzle to solve.\n\nÂ§3An ME Annihilation Plane is good for automatically harvesting these."
