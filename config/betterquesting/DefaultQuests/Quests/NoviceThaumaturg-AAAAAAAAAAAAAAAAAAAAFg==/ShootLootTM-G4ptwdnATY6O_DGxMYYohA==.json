The Miser\u0027s Pearl, on the other hand, will be.\n\nThe Miser\u0027s Pearl is basically a stable Avarice Pearl - no risk of breaking or damaging you. Throw it, and items come flying at you. It\u0027s limited to up to ten different stacks of items, and requires Ordo Vis from a wand to be thrown, but that\u0027s worth it not breaking.\n\nNow you\u0027ll be able to take on those hollow hills in the Twilight without having to worry about needing to leave any loot behind should you be forced to beat a hasty retreat. Or any other situation where treasure dispensers within range of your crossbow aren\u0027t within convenient walking distance."
