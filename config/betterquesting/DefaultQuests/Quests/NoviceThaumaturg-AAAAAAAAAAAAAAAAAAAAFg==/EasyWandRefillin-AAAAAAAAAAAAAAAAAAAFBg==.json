If you\u0027re not turning into an underweight stick you\u0027re clearly doing it wrong.\n\nAnd you were. The Vishrooms your mentor told you about are able to store Vis, but they have no way of releasing it. By using a simple crucible recipe you are able to create Primal Shrooms, which - once grown - can be broken to release a rain of Vis orbs, like when you defeat a mob. Better yet, these primal shrooms respond to fertilizer as well as a watering can. Vis is now just a quick bit of gardening away.\n\nSpeaking of gardening, a Pumpkin and 4 Tiny Piles of Stone Dust should be perfect for creating these mushrooms. As for Visrooms, they only appear in Magical Forests as far as your mentor knows. Where did you put that old Nature\u0027s Compass...\n\nÂ§3You can also buy Visrooms from the Coins, Coins, Coins tab."
