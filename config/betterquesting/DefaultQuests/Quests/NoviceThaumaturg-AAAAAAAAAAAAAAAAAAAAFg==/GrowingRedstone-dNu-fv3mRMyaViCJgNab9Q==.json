Given a bit of Essentia, what else could you convince these plants to grow for you?\n\nThe answer turns out to be \"not very much\". The process is quite a bit more taxing on the seeds than you expected. But one managed to survive your experiments.\n\nRedlon is a changed melon seed (pumpkin seeds, for whatever reason, refuse to work) that grows blocks of Redstone. Albeit, slower than a regular melon seed would grow melons.\n\nThe next question is how to automate harvesting these things, as you\u0027d rather not do so manually. And given that blocks of Redstone emit a redstone signal perhaps there\u0027s a simple solution to this one..."
