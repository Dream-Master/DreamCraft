So figuring out how to monitor your stockpiles seems prudent.\n\nThe Vis Reader is able to monitor the content of Warded Jars, essential acting as a very fancy Comparator. Either place them directly below the jar (or other Essentia container) you wish for them to monitor, or place a Remote Comparator on top with a Crystalline Eye watching the relevant container.\n\nVis Readers have a number of different modes and options, which can be accessed by right clicking them with a wand. The Thaumonomicon explains them, though one note to add is that Vis Readers are limited to a set selection of constant values to compare to. These values cap out at 125, so if you plan on storing much more Vis than that you might need a different solution."
