Surely there\u0027s a way to do it automatically.\n\nWith your new Arcane Infusion setup, it is. Void Jars function the exact same as Warded Jars, only they are able to accept Essentia even when they\u0027re full. Any excess will be summarily donated to charity.\n\nWhat? Just because the eldritch monsters from beyond the barrier between worlds are trying to lure you to their domain to consume your soul (or drive you nuts with chicken eggs, either/or) doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re not good citizens helping support their local excess Essentia collection center."
