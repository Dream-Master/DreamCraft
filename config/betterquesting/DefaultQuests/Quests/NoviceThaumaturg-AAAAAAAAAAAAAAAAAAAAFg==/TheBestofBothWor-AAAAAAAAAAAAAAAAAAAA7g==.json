      "desc:8": "You have made great strides in using your wand to channel primal Vis to bind all kinds of magic items together. You have also made amazing advancements in taming the normally unstable Essentia.\n\nYou are now ready to combine the two disciplines together, and start the most complex magic crafting you have performed yet.\n\nFirst you\u0027ll need to prepare a suitably large space. Infusing items with Essentia is going to require keeping the local flow of magic stable, lest conditions occur that allows Essentia to turn into Flux. At most you can use a 23x16x23 space, but you\u0027re confident even a modest 9x8x9 cube(-ish) below your altar will see you through challenging infusions (provided you reserve most of that space for stabilizers).\n\nOnce you\u0027ve prepared an area you\u0027ll need to place an Arcane Pedestal in the center. Place four Arcane Stone Bricks diagonally, and on top of those place Arcane Stone. Two blocks above the pedestal place the Runic Matrix, and use your wand to activate the mystical construct.\n\nNext you need to place the other pedestals, but this is where symmetry comes in. Building symmetrically helps keep the altar stable - at least, blocks related to the infusion altar do. What random bits of dirt and stone lie beneath is irrelevant. Exactly where and how you place the pedestals doesn\u0027t matter, so long as they are within range and symmetric with respect to the central pedestal.\n\nTo craft recipes you will need to place the center item on the central pedestal, and place the encircling items on the other pedestals. Placing them exactly as they are shown in the Thaumonomicon doesn\u0027t matter, nor what items oppose which. All that matters is that items on pedestals have a symmetric partner.\n\nNote that if a recipe calls for an uneven amount of items it\u0027s impossible for all of them to have a partner. That\u0027s fine, the same will happen during the final phase of crafting in any case. Ensuring the Infusion Altar has more stability than the recipe is unstable is a given due to this, if nothing else.\n\nFinally, ensure that the Infusion Altar has access to the required Essentia. For now you will be feeding it manually through placing Warded Jars within range. Since jars safely contain Essentia they will not affect the local flow of Vis, meaning symmetry does not matter for them.\n\nIf an Infusion Altar is insufficiently stable, or becomes unstable as a result of required Essentia or items not being present, §obad things§r will happen. Flux will be produced, items can get knocked off pedestals, magic discharges can strike nearby Thaumaturges, items could even get outright dissolved into flux.\n\nTo start a craft right click the Runic Matrix with your wand. If you wish to stop a craft remove the item on the central pedestal. Any already consumed Essentia and items will be wasted, so do this only as a measure of last resort.\n\n§3Blocks that act as infusion stabilizers mention as much on their tooltip, so seach for \"infusion stabilizer\" in NEI to quickly filter what helps keep an altar stable."
