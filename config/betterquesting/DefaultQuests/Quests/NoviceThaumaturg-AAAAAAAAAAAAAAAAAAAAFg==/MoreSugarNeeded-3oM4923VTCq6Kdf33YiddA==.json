Or at least, easier to process than Sugar Cane.\n\nSweeds ended up being the former case. They must be planted on grass, not farmland, and will spread to propogate themselves. Once fully matured they can be harvested for sugar as well as sugar cane.\n\nHonestly, you\u0027re pretty pleased with this outcome. You got the easy sugar you wanted, and an extra supply of sugar cane at the same time."
