That said the unstable nature of Essentia, used to fuel the most complex magic crafts you\u0027ve performed to date, is worrying you.\n\nYou have plans drawn for how to make sure the process remains stable, but a method of telling exactly how stable \"stable\" is seems prudent.\n\nThe Arcane Abacus does just that. Right clicking a Runic Matrix will show the total stability, as well as list anything that is negatively affecting stability. Should an infusion recipe be laid out it will also show the base instability of it, as well as the essentia cost in specific cases like Runic Shielding Augmentation.\n\nAn Arcane Abacus can similarly be used on nodes to calculate the total amount of primal Vis contained within all it\u0027s aspects, though you\u0027re not sure what actually uses this information. Energizing nodes, for example, only cares about the highest source. Not the total."
