In response to your confused querry he showed you a bright flower in his own garden, emitting a purifying light.\n\nThese Ethereal Blooms will remove Tainted Lands within a small area around themselves, which in turn kills off any Fibrous Tendrils. They cannot cleanse Tainted Nodes, nor will they necessarily return tainted biomes back to what they were before, but they will provide a barrier.\n\nThe Shimmerleaf they are made from have a recipe in an LV Assembling Machine if you\u0027re having a hard time finding them around Silverwood trees. There is also an IC2 crop version of them."
