By adding a layer of enchanted fabric onto your gold caps you have created wand caps that are even better at channeling Vis than the gold caps were!\n\nWith these you will be able to craft an even better upgraded wand than you originally anticipated. Sure, given you\u0027ll have left behind more than one wand before you\u0027ve no doubt that you will retire your soon to be Satin-entwined Greatwood Wand one day as well.\n\nBut the knowledge that these wand caps exist is yours now. Any future wands you intend to craft with gold caps you will have the option to make just a little bit better, potentially. And that, you think, is worth it.\n\nÂ§3A Satin-Entwined Greatwood Wand, combined with Goggles of Revealing, Bewitched Robes/Leggings, and Thaumaturge\u0027s Boots can directly craft a Gold-Banded Greatwood Scepter."
