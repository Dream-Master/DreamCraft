You can right click a source of safely contained Essentia - as in an Alembic or Warded Jar, but not a Crucible - to fill a Phial, or right click to empty the Phial\u0027s content into a Warded Jar (or similar).\n\nPhials can generally be reused, including for moving around Essentia or crafting labels already filtered for a specific Essentia type. They will be consumed in certain crafting processes, such as the one described in the quest following this one.\n\nDespite showing no aspects when scanned filled Phials do contain the amount of Essentia listed on their tooltip, so they can be I.E. thrown into a crucible... though why you\u0027d want to do that at this stage is beyond me."
