Essentia is Vis in a different state, somewhat akin to water and ice, giving it different properties and uses. Unfortunately Essentia is quite unstable. Something your mentor pointedly notes he\u0027ll discuss in greater, important detail later.\n\nYou\u0027ll need to give a cauldron a good whack with a wand to turn it into something more suitable for working with these barely stable magics. After that you\u0027ll need to add water, to help keep the Essentia contained and stable, as well as a heat source below the crucible to make sure items will actually break down into Essentia.\n\nYou will also (much to your chagrin) need to make sure to finish any work with your new Crucible yourself. Expecting a box with a hole cut into it to control a swirl of barely contained unstable magic is suicidally optimistic."
