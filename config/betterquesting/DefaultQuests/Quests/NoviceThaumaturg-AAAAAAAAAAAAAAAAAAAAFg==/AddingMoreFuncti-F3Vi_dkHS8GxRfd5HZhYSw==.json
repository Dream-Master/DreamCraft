You couldn\u0027t figure out anything to do with Aqua slivers, but five out of six isn\u0027t bad.\n\nIn any case, right now you are most interested in Dense Redcrystal. Anyone who knows what Redstone is has set up a comparator before. With Dense Redcrystal you will now be able to do that with one item, and with much greater control over the signal\u0027s direction.\n\nLike you can use your wand to toggle the four directions, you can use your wand on the main crystal to set how strong a signal needs to be in order to pass through.\n\nThere is, however, one caveat. Since a signal has to travel through Dense Redcrystal to be compared it will be slightly weaker by the time it gets there. Basically, Comparators check the signal strength of the redstone one block behind them, whereas Dense Redcrystal checks the signal strength of the block space they are in. That one block space difference will change the signal strength being compared, and is something you will have to keep in mind."
