To that end you\u0027ve tried to crystallize redstone dust the same way you crystallize the primal shards, thinking this would solve your problems.\n\nUnfortunately that attempt was not successful. The redstone crystal lost all of it\u0027s redstone properties, but with a bit of tweaking you\u0027ve come up with this functional recipe.\n\nRedcrystal can be placed directly against a wall or ceiling, and also allows you to use a wand to toggle whether a given side sends/receives any redstone signals. This allows for nice and compact builds in places regular redstone couldn\u0027t even exist in the first place.\n\nYou wonder if it is possible to further improve these redcrystals, to allow them to manipulate or process the signal they\u0027re receiving in some way..."
