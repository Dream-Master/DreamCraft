      "desc:8": "You\u0027re eager to dive into this new field of study, but your mentor cautions you to be a bit more patient. Just a bit. Alongside the untapped potential you call Vis there exists two forms of power that, left unchecked, will devour you body and soul - Taint and Warp. Taint is an aspect of magic you haven\u0027t gotten to yet, so your mentor merely says he\u0027ll discuss that later.\n\nWarp is a corruption that occurs when Thaumaturges learn to recognize what exists beyond the worlds they know, the patterns that spell out the space between the portals you\u0027ve used, or are attacked by those from there. Warp serves to draw you to that space, to confront it in it\u0027s own lair... though for what reason your mentor doesn\u0027t say.\n\nNoticing that, for someone who clearly has all of this forbidden knowledge, you mentor seems perfectly sane. So you have to assume there are ways to overcome Warp. Your mentor nods, and promises that when your apprenticeship with him is over, you will be ready to enter that confrontation.\n\nAnd, if you succeed, you will find a way to silence the voices forever. As he did.\n\nWarp Theory adds a bunch of new Warp Effects to the Player. Keep an eye on it, because you don\u0027t want to spawn a Wither in your base.\n\n5 warp: Message\n10 warp: Fake Explosion\n15 warp: Coin, Pumpkin\n20 warp: Lay Eggs, Spawn Phantoms\n25 warp: Fake Creeper, Fake Rain\n30 warp: GregTech Fake Sounds, Spawn Bats\n35 warp: Blood, Fake Enderman\n40 warp: Spawn Friendly Creeper\n45 warp: Jump Boost, Nausea\n50 warp: Insomnia, Vis Drain\n55 warp: Thunderstorm\n60 warp: Spawn Fire Bats\n65 warp: Blindness, Poison\n70 warp: Livestock Rain\n75 warp: Spawn Doppelganger\n80 warp: Spawn Endermen, Wither Potion\n85 warp: Wind\n90 warp: Ender Pearl\n95 warp: Blaze Fireball\n100 warp: Litmus Paper, Junk\n110 warp: Obsidian\n120 warp: Lightning\n125 warp: Inventory Swap\n130 warp: Random Teleport\n140 warp: Acceleration\n150 warp: Fake Wither, Inventory Scramble\n160 warp: Countdown Bomb\n170 warp: Mushrooms\n175 warp: Snow\n180 warp: Decay\n190 warp: Swamp\n200 warp: Spawn Wither\n\nÂ§3A Voiding Drop Filter, for which there is a quest in the LV tab, is an eggcellent solution for some of the eary warp effects."
